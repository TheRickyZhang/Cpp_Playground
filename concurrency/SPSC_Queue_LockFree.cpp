/*
  A pretty standard and educational problem for atomics and lock-free data structures. We mainly follow a few key ideas:
- The queue can be represented as a single fixed-size buffer. Since T is default constructible, we can assign to live elements.
- With the SPSC guarantee that producers all call push() on one thread, and consumers call pop() on another, we can fully represent our state with an atomic<size_t> head, tail. Note that unsigned is superior here because want the defined overflow behavior, as all that matters is the unsigned difference between the values. 
- Rest of the big 5 are deleted, because invariants are impossible to maintain when querying a separate concurrent structure
- operations follow procedure: for things only touched by our current thread, load relaxed, otherwise load acquire. Then when we publish to other thread, store release.
- Many performance considerations, such as preventing false sharing with atomics, caching head/tail on each thread, using bitmask for the size 2 restriction

To give you an idea on impact of some performance, just based on submission timing (going from ~750ms -> ~275ms):
- adding a cached head/tail to avoid acquire loads every time: saves ~425ms
- Using direct assignment instead of constructing from memory: saves ~40ms
- Strong the mask separately instead of using cap-1 every time: saves ~5ms
- Adding a local head/tail to avoid all relaxed loads: saves ~5ms

* SPSC is external contract! We assume that whoever is using it will ONLY call push() with one thread, and only pop() with the other thread.
* Think about acquire / release like a sync point among different threads
