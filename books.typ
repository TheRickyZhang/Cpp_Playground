*Done:*
Options, Derivatives, and Other Futures (Hull) - first 10 chapters

*Currently Reading:*
C++ Software Design (Iglberger)
Remember SOLID:
S: Single Responsibility
O: Open Closed Principle             - Document class; easy to add to, hard to modify
L: LSP Liskov Substitution principle - Rectangle/square class; derived objects (is-a) should be directly substitutable, following all the assumptions of parent.
  - Cannot strengthen or weaken conditions in child
  - Return types are covariant: subset (enforced in C++)
  - Function parameters are contravariant: superset (not enforced)
I: Interface Segregation Principle   - Do not depend on interfaces that aren't used 
D: Dependency Inversion Principle    - Depend on abstractions over the concrete

*TODO:*
OSTEP
